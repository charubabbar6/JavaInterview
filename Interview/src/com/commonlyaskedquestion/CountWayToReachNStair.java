/*4. Count the no of ways to reach the nth stair.

There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to climb stairs to reach the nth stair. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time, the task is to count the number of ways that a person can reach at the top.

/*
In the above approach it can be seen that dp[i] only depends on previous states.
We can optimize the space complexity of the dynamic programming solution to O(1) by using only two variables prev1 and prev2
to keep track of the previous two values of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]. Since we only need these two values to calculate the next value,
 we donâ€™t need to store the entire array.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
